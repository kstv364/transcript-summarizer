    Welcome to our quarterly board meeting. I'm pleased to report that this has been 
    our strongest quarter yet, with revenue reaching $4.2 million, representing a 
    28% increase from the same quarter last year.
    
    Our growth has been driven primarily by three factors: expansion into the European 
    market, the successful launch of our new product line, and improved customer 
    retention rates. The European expansion alone contributed $800,000 in new revenue.
    
    On the operational side, we've made significant investments in our infrastructure. 
    We've hired 15 new engineers, upgraded our data centers, and implemented new 
    security protocols. These investments position us well for continued growth.
    
    Customer satisfaction scores have improved to 4.6 out of 5, up from 4.1 last quarter. 
    Our new customer support team and enhanced product features have been key drivers 
    of this improvement.
    
    Looking ahead to next quarter, we're planning to launch in two additional markets 
    and introduce three new product features. We expect this to drive another 20-25% 
    growth in revenue.
    
    However, we're also monitoring some challenges. Supply chain costs have increased 
    by 12%, and we're seeing increased competition in our core markets. We have 
    strategies in place to address both of these issues.
    
    In terms of financial health, our cash position remains strong at $2.1 million, 
    and we're on track to achieve profitability by the end of next quarter.
    
    Are there any questions about our performance or strategy going forward?
